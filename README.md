## Overview

A Ruby on Rails application for displaying my collection of hats, and allowing for user comments, using the Bootstraps framework.

## Using the application

The home page allows users to create an account, or sign in from the navigation bar. The homepage will display the three most recently added hats.

Clicking on the "View Hats" option in the navigation bar will allow users to browse through all hats, sorting them by clicking the rows at the top of the list of hats.  A search bar can also be found in the top right hand side of the website.
